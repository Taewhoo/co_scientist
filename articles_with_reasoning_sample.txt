ALS, Nuclear Pore Complex, and Nucleoporin Phosphorylation: Recent Mechanistic Insights

CHMP2B promotes CHMP7 mediated nuclear pore complex injury in sporadic ALS (2024)​

Acta Neuropathologica Communications (Keeley et al., 2024) – This study uncovers a mechanism by which an ESCRT-III nuclear envelope surveillance pathway drives nuclear pore complex (NPC) defects in ALS. Using human iPSC-derived neurons from sporadic ALS patients, the authors found that the CHMP7 protein (an ESCRT-III regulator) abnormally accumulates at the nucleus, triggering the loss of specific nucleoporins (like POM121) from NPCs​. They identified CHMP2B (another ESCRT-III protein) as a key upstream factor: CHMP7 overactivation in ALS neurons depends on CHMP2B, and partial knockdown of CHMP2B restored NPC composition and prevented TDP-43 mislocalization​. Notably, reducing CHMP2B or CHMP7 activity alleviated nuclear pore “injury” and downstream TDP-43 dysfunction, highlighting a causal link between NPC damage and the hallmark TDP-43 pathology of ALS​. Connection to nucleoporin phosphorylation and hypothesis development: This work positions the ESCRT-mediated removal of nucleoporins as a pathogenic event, suggesting that aberrant signaling may mark NPCs for turnover in ALS. One possible trigger for such NPC injury is the post-translational modification of nucleoporins. In healthy cells, NPC disassembly (e.g. during mitosis) is initiated by multisite phosphorylation of nucleoporins​​. The ALS context may mimic a “partial mitotic” signal: chronic cellular stress can activate kinases like p38 or JNK that phosphorylate nucleoporins (e.g. Nup62, Nup98, Nup214), as shown under oxidative stress conditions​. Building on the CHMP7/CHMP2B findings, we hypothesize that in ALS neurons, stress-activated kinases aberrantly phosphorylate a nucleoporin (or associated NPC protein), flagging the NPC for ESCRT-III–mediated clearance. This would lead to NPC deterioration and TDP-43 mislocalization. A feasible experiment to test this is to prevent nucleoporin phosphorylation (for instance, by mutating key phosphorylation sites or using kinase inhibitors) in ALS models and assess whether CHMP7 recruitment and nucleoporin loss are blocked. If phospho-mutant nucleoporins resist CHMP7-mediated removal and preserve TDP-43’s nuclear localization, it would directly implicate phosphorylation as the molecular switch that initiates NPC pathology in ALS.

Multiple lines of evidence for disruption of nuclear lamina and nucleoporins in FUS-ALS (2024)​

Brain (Okada et al., 2024) – Focusing on an ALS model with a mutant FUS gene, this study provides compelling in vivo evidence that structural NPC damage is a driving pathological event. The researchers generated knock-in mice carrying an ALS-linked FUS mutation and observed age-dependent motor neuron degeneration accompanied by pronounced nuclear envelope abnormalities​. In mutant FUS motor neurons, the nuclear lamina was disrupted and multiple nucleoporins were lost or mislocalized – a phenotype mirrored in patient-derived FUS-ALS iPSC neurons and postmortem ALS spinal cord tissue​. These convergent findings across mouse and human systems indicate that FUS mutations instigate NPC instability, DNA damage, and neuronal death​. The authors propose that NPC disruption is a “definitive pathogenic mechanism” in ALS-FUS and even a potential therapeutic target​. This work lays a foundation by linking a genetic ALS trigger (mutant FUS) to downstream NPC breakdown, though the precise molecular steps from FUS mutation to nucleoporin damage remain unclear. Connection to nucleoporin phosphorylation and hypothesis development: The FUS-ALS model reveals a gap: how does mutant FUS cause nuclear pore and lamina disruption? One clue is that FUS pathology can activate stress pathways (e.g. FUS aggregates were reported to hyperactivate p38 MAPK​) which might in turn modify NPC components. Given that mitotic kinases are known to phosphorylate nuclear lamina proteins and nucleoporins to drive nuclear envelope disassembly​
, a plausible hypothesis is that FUS mutations induce chronic activation of such kinases in neurons. We hypothesize that mutant FUS (or its mislocalized RNA/protein aggregates) aberrantly activates a kinase cascade that hyper-phosphorylates nuclear lamins or scaffold nucleoporins, weakening the nuclear structure and initiating NPC breakdown. This mechanism would connect a post-translational modification (phosphorylation) to the structural phenotypes observed in FUS-ALS. To test this, one could examine FUS mutant neurons for elevated phosphorylation on nuclear lamina components (e.g. Lamin B) or key nucleoporins during early disease stages. If found, pharmacologically inhibiting the identified kinase (for example, a p38 or CDK inhibitor) in FUS-ALS mice should preserve NPC integrity and nuclear TDP-43 localization. Successful rescue of NPC stability and neuron survival by kinase inhibition would strongly support a model in which nucleoporin (or lamina) phosphorylation links FUS mutations to ALS neurodegeneration.

NUP62 localizes to ALS/FTLD pathological assemblies and contributes to TDP-43 insolubility (2022)​

Nature Communications (Gleixner et al., 2022) – This study zeroes in on nucleoporin NUP62 and its interaction with TDP-43, the protein that forms toxic cytoplasmic aggregates in ~97% of ALS cases. The authors discovered that NUP62 (an FG-repeat nucleoporin normally lining the NPC channel) abnormally redistributes in ALS/FTD models with TDP-43 pathology. In cellular assays, toxic dipeptide repeats associated with C9ORF72-ALS provoke loss of nuclear Nup62 and its accumulation in cytoplasmic inclusions alongside TDP-43​. Strikingly, cytoplasmic NUP62 directly binds TDP-43 and promotes its phase separation into insoluble condensates​. Gleixner et al. demonstrated that when NUP62 is recruited into TDP-43-rich assemblies, TDP-43 becomes less mobile and more aggregation-prone​. Conversely, reducing NUP62 levels or preventing its mislocalization can mitigate TDP-43 aggregation (in model systems), suggesting NUP62 is an active “aggregator” of TDP-43. Thus, this paper reveals a novel pathogenic feedback loop: nucleoporin mislocalization exacerbates TDP-43 proteinopathy, which in turn could further impair nuclear transport. It provides a mechanistic link between an NPC component and the core toxic pathology in ALS. Connection to nucleoporin phosphorylation and hypothesis development: While this study centers on NUP62’s mislocalization and binding to TDP-43, it opens questions about what causes NUP62 to disengage from the NPC in the first place. One possibility is abnormal post-translational modification of NUP62 altering its interactions. Phosphorylation is known to regulate the behavior of FG-nucleoporins; for instance, in oxidative stress, Nup62 becomes hyper-phosphorylated and shows reduced binding to other FG-Nups, favoring new interactions (like with exportin CRM1)​. Building on Gleixner et al.’s findings, we propose that stress-induced phosphorylation of NUP62 could trigger its dissociation from the NPC and drive it into the cytosol, where it seeds TDP-43 aggregation. This hypothesis can be tested by examining post-mortem ALS tissue or cell models for phospho-NUP62 enrichment in cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. If NUP62 in aggregates is found to be phosphorylated at specific sites (compared to nuclear NUP62), one could mutate those sites to non-phosphorylatable residues in cell models. The expectation is that a phospho-deficient NUP62 would be less prone to mislocalize and co-aggregate with TDP-43. Indeed, an experiment could involve expressing wild-type NUP62 versus a phosphorylation-site mutant in ALS model neurons under stress: a reduction in TDP-43 insolubility and cytoplasmic inclusions in the phospho-site mutant condition would support the idea that phosphorylation drives NUP62’s pathological role. Such results would not only identify a trigger for NUP62/TDP-43 co-aggregation but also pinpoint a potential kinase or signaling pathway to target for mitigating TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Nuclear pore and transport machinery impairment under stress – role of Nup post-translational modifications (2024)​
​
Molecular Neurodegeneration (Shrimali et al., 2024) – This recent review synthesizes findings on how cellular stress can damage NPCs, highlighting post-translational modifications (PTMs) of nucleoporins as pivotal regulators of NPC integrity. Although not focused exclusively on ALS, it provides mechanistic insight applicable to neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, the authors discuss how reactive oxygen species and related stress kinases (ERK, JNK, p38) can aberrantly target NPC components. Under acute oxidative stress, studies showed increased phosphorylation of multiple nucleoporins (Nup153, Nup62, Nup98, Nup214) coupled with their mislocalization​. Simultaneously, these Nups lost normal interactions and instead bound incorrect partners (e.g. exportins), effectively clogging transport channels​. Such stress-induced NPC alterations mirror a partial breakdown of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, reminiscent of what is observed in degenerating neurons. The review also notes that NPC disassembly is a phosphorylation-driven process in dividing cells, and suggests that unscheduled activation of these pathways in neurons could lead to pathological “leakiness” or NPC injury​. In summary, this article underscores a plausible mechanism: imbalanced phosphorylation and other PTMs on nucleoporins can destabilize the NPC, contributing to neuron dysfunction. Connection to nucleoporin phosphorylation and hypothesis development: Extrapolating to ALS, this comprehensive view helps identify specific regulatory nodes for experimentation. The review implies that kinases normally active in mitosis or stress responses might be hijacked in post-mitotic neurons, causing NPC damage via nucleoporin phosphorylation​​. A novel hypothesis inspired by these insights is that ALS neurons suffer from a chronic “stress mitosis” signal – for example, an ALS-related factor (mutant protein, DPR, or chronic inflammation) could persistently activate cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) or mitogen-activated protein kinases. These kinases would phosphorylate nucleoporins such as Nup98 or Nup62 at multiple sites, weakening the NPC scaffold and creating abnormal pores. This mechanism would integrate with known ALS phenotypes: a leaky or disrupted NPC would mislocalize RNA-binding proteins (like TDP-43 and FUS) and impede nuclear import of critical factors, leading to the observed neuronal death. A concrete experimental approach is to induce ALS-like stress in neurons (e.g. oxidative or DPR exposure) and then rescue NPC integrity by applying specific kinase inhibitors (such as a CDK1 inhibitor or a p38-MAPK inhibitor). If NPC components (assessed by structured imaging or biochemical fractionation) remain unphosphorylated and correctly localized under inhibitor treatment, and if treated neurons show restored nuclear protein import/export and improved survival, it would strongly validate the role of nucleoporin phosphorylation in ALS. Moreover, identifying which nucleoporins are phosphorylated in ALS models (via phospho-proteomics) could pinpoint the exact “Achilles’ heel” of the NPC. This would inform a therapeutic strategy: for instance, preventing the phosphorylation of a particular nucleoporin (through gene editing or a targeted small molecule) could be tested for its ability to halt or slow ALS-like degeneration in experimental systems.
